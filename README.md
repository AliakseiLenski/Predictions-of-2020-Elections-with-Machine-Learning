# Predictions-of-2020-Elections-with-Machine-Learning
Applying Supervised &amp; Unsupervised to datasets related to 2020 elections. Figuring out which method is the most accurate and then drawing a map of counties for which the results were predicted accurately.

First, performing Exploratory Data Analysis with both the elections dataset and census for 2020. Then transforming the data by combining 2 datasets and getting rid of the columns that would not be necessary for the further analysis.

Secondly, applying hierarchical clustering with the new combined dataset to see how the machine would group and classify certain variables.

Thridly, performing three Supervised methods on the data and check their accuracy by firstly calculating the error rates and then drawing ROC curves.

Concluding the project by applying several more models and drawing the final county map depicting the accuracy of the most accurate Supervised method.
